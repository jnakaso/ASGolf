# AS Golf
This is the home for [AS Golf], graciously hosted by [PowerPC Consulting].  It was created with three goals in mind:
  1. Provide current scheduling and handicap information to AS Golf Club members.
  2. Settling bar bets regarding who is the worst sandbagger using data.
  3. Let [me] investigate new web technologies.
## Web Technologies
  - [Angular](https://angularjs.org)
  - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
  - [UI-Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
